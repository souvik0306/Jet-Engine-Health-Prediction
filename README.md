# Jet-Engine-Health-Prediction

### Objectives - 
• Predicted Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for turbofan jet engines using a Random Forest Classifier Model. 

• Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on NASA’s Dataset and analyzed feature correlation using Seaborn. 

• Applied hyperparameter optimization using Randomized Search CV and increased F1-Score to an overall 91.2%.

### Random Forest - 
The random forest is a classification algorithm consisting of many decisions trees. It uses bagging and feature randomness when building each individual tree to try to create an uncorrelated forest of trees whose prediction by committee is more accurate than that of any individual tree.
